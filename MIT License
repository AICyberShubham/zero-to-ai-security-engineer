# Phase 0: The Mindset & Your Arsenal

Before writing a single line of code, it's crucial to prepare your mind and your environment. This phase is about setting yourself up for long-term success.

### 🧠 Cultivating the Right Mindset

-   **Be a T-Shaped Professional:** Develop deep expertise in AI Security (the vertical bar of the 'T'), but also have broad knowledge in related fields like general security, software engineering, and data science (the horizontal bar).
-   **Embrace Lifelong Learning:** This field changes weekly. Get comfortable with being a beginner. Follow researchers, read papers, and never stop being curious.
-   **Think Like an Attacker and a Defender:** To build robust defenses, you must first understand how to break things. Cultivate a curious, adversarial mindset.
-   **Focus on Fundamentals:** Trends and tools will change, but the core principles of math, programming, and security are timeless.

### 🛠️ Setting Up Your Arsenal (Your Development Environment)

-   **Code Editor:** [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is the industry standard. It's free, lightweight, and has a massive extension library.
-   **Version Control:** Learn **Git**. It's non-negotiable. Create a [GitHub](https://github.com/) account and use it to track all your projects. This will become your portfolio.
-   **Python Environment:**
    -   Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).
    -   Learn to use **virtual environments** (`venv` or **[Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)**) to manage project dependencies. This prevents package conflicts and is a critical best practice.
-   **Command Line:** Get comfortable with the terminal/command line for your OS (Linux/macOS: Terminal, Windows: WSL or PowerShell). It's essential for running scripts, managing environments, and using tools like Git.
