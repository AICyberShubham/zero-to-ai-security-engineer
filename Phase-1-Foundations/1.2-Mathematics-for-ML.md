### 1.2 Mathematics for Machine Learning

AI algorithms are built on mathematical concepts. Understanding them allows you to implement and troubleshoot algorithms more effectively.

#### Key Topics to Learn:

-   **Linear Algebra:**
    -   **Vectors and Matrices:** The core of how data is represented and manipulated in ML.
    -   **Dot Product, Matrix Multiplication, Transpose.**
    -   **Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:** An advanced topic, but fundamental for understanding algorithms like PCA.
-   **Calculus:**
    -   **Derivatives and Gradients:** Essential for optimizing models (e.g., Gradient Descent).
    -   **Chain Rule:** The key to understanding how Neural Networks learn (Backpropagation).
-   **Probability and Statistics:**
    -   **Mean, Median, Mode, Standard Deviation.**
    -   **Probability Distributions** (Normal, Binomial).
    -   **Bayes' Theorem:** Important for classification algorithms like Naive Bayes.
