### 1.1 Programming: The Language of AI

**Python** is the dominant language in AI/ML. Its vast library support (like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, TensorFlow) and beginner-friendly syntax make it the industry standard.

#### Key Topics to Learn:

-   **Basic Syntax:** Variables, data types (int, float, string), operators.
-   **Data Structures:** Lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets.
-   **Control Flow:** `if-else` statements, `for` and `while` loops.
-   **Functions:** Creating and using functions to organize code.
-   **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Understanding classes and objects.
-   **File Handling:** Reading from and writing to files.
-   **Virtual Environments:** Using `venv` or `conda` to isolate project dependencies. This is a crucial best practice.
-   **Jupyter Notebooks:** Learn how to use them for interactive coding and data visualization.
